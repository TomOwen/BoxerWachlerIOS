            <div><big>He is a highly sought after eye surgeon and is known as "The
                Surgeon's Surgeon" since so many other surgeons come to Dr. Brian for
                surgery on their own eyes â€“ including eye surgeons, brain surgeons,
                orthopedic surgeons, plastic surgeons, and breast cancer surgeons to
                just name a few.</big></div>

            <div style="text-align: justify;"><big>Doctors representing all parts
                of the Medical field commonly fly in from around the United States and
                outside countries to have Dr. Brian treat them with his unique and
                proprietary treatments. His surgery patients also include many
                Registered Nurses and Pharmacists. Dr. Brian is also sought after by
                numerous celebrities, film and TV stars, famous musicians, professional
                athletes, CEOs, and goverment leaders in the United States and abroad
                who literally have millions of dollars on the line and trust only Dr.
                Brian with their eyes.<br>
                <br>
                One of Dr. Brian's special qualities is that although he sees patients
                from all "walks of life" (famous and non-famous), Dr. Brian is
                described as one of the most "down to earth" doctors people have met.
                Everyone receives the same high quality of care regardless if you are a
                famous celebrity or a manual laborer in the field. He has a special
                empathy for all people who have eye problems and his career mission is
                to help everyone who needs him. </big> <br>
