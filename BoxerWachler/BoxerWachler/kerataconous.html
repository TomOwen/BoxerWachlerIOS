        <strong>Overview:</strong> Keratoconus is a progressive eye disease, which causes a characteristic thinning and cone-like steepening of the cornea. This steepening results in distortion of vision, increased sensitivity to glare and light, as well as reduction in visual acuity. As the condition progresses, many patients will need to wear customized contact lenses to improve quality of vision. If not treated early enough, contact lenses can become increasingly intolerable, causing pain, infections, and corneal ulcers or abrasions. In the worst cases, untreated Keratoconus can lead to the need for a highly invasive and risky procedure, called a Corneal Transplant.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Boxer Wachler has devoted his life to helping patients save their eyesight and avoid corneal transplants. He is the inventor of the first crosslinking procedure in North America, called Holcomb C3-R<sup>&reg;</sup>, as well as the first to use Intacs for Keratoconus. He has perfected numerous techniques over the years, in order to give the most benefit of vision improvement, with the least amount risk involved.

        <h3>Keratoconus Procedures</h3>
        <p>
        <strong>Intacs</strong> are tiny plastic segments, which help to normalize the cone shape of the cornea. This is a minimally invasive procedure (even less invasive than Lasik!) The tiny segments are custom-placed in the peripheral section of the cornea, and hold back the cone/bulging so that light rays can better focus on the retina. Intacs help to reduce visual distortions (i.e. glare/halo), and improve the quality of vision in contacts or glasses. This procedure will also help to achieve better comfort/fit in contact lenses. Some patients will be able to have improvement in their uncorrected vision, but this will depend on the severity of their condition.

        <strong>Holcomb C3-R<sup>&reg;</sup></strong> is a 30 minute, non-invasive procedure, which stimulates collagen growth within the cornea to help strengthen, stabilize, and halt the progression of Keratoconus. This procedure will help prevent further loss of vision, as well as the need for a corneal transplant. Ideally, patients should seek this treatment as early as possible to prevent future progression that will occur in the future.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Boxer Wachler has treated thousands of patients from all over the world since 2003. Less than 1% of these patients have needed any second treatment to achieve full stabilization and halt progression of the disease.
        <br><br>
        Holcomb C3-R<sup>&reg;</sup> should not be compared to any other form of crosslinking.  The solution and techniques are proprietary, so you know you are getting the "real thing"!

        <strong>CK</strong> is a non-surgical procedure, which uses a tiny heat probe (non-laser) to change the shape of your cornea, thus changing the focus of your eye. This procedure helps to reduce astigmatism, which causes distortion in Keratoconus patients' vision. Dr. Boxer Wachler customizes the placement and number of spots per patient. If there is room for further improvement, additional CK spots can be added. It is important to note that CK should be combined with Holcomb C3-R<sup>&reg;</sup> (or performed at a later date after Holcomb C3-R<sup>&reg;</sup>) in order to reduce the chances of regression of the effects of CK and maximize long-term benefits.

        <strong>Visian ICL</strong> is an insertable lens, which is placed behind the iris (colored portion of the eye) and in front the natural lens. This procedure helps to reduce overall prescription in patients with high myopia (nearsightedness).  If recommended by Dr. Brian, once the cornea has been stabilized with a combination of the above procedures, a patient can consider the Visian ICL procedure at approximately 3-6 months after primary treatment is completed. This technology aims to improve the uncorrected vision; however, many patients will still need to wear glasses or contacts for the best quality of vision. In some cases, the procedure can eliminate the need for contacts or glasses.
