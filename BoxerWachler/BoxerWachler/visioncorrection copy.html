    <h2>Vision Correction</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    Everyone's eyes are different. Therefore, we may not all be a candidate for the same procedures to help us see better. When you come in for a consultation, Dr. Brian will recommend a plan to improve your quality of vision while also taking into account what is the safest option for you.

    <b>Ultrasound-Guided Visian ICL is bicompatible and "in sync" with the body.</b>
    The Ultrasound-Guided Visian ICL is removable and provides "HD Vision". Over 500,000 procedures have been done worldwide.
    <br><br>
    The procedure is outpatient and can be typically performed in 10 minutes per eye with the goal of improvement to the patient's vision by the very next day. Ultrasound-Guided Visian ICL<sup>&#153;</sup> can also be updated with a new prescription should vision change in the future. Potential benefit of Ultrasound-Guided Visian ICL<sup>&#153;</sup> is improved eyesight and potential risks are suboptimal vision, infection, inflammation, loss of vision among others. That is the reason that Dr. Brian and every staff member is highly "detail-oriented" about every step of the process for every patient. Dr. Brian and his team have published results in the medical literature and presented results at numerous medical conferences on Ultrasound-Guided Visian ICL<sup>&#153;</sup>.
    <br><br>
    <b>Dr. Brian uses a specialized ultrasound device to determine the idealized size of the ICL. The ICL is customized to not just each person, but EACH EYE of each person.</b>
    <br><br>
    FUN FACT:
    <br><br>
    <u>The United States military commonly uses the Ultrasound-Guided Visian ICL on those who serve our country.</u> Their government-funded studies found Ultrasound-Guided Visian ICL provides superior vision over LASIK for higher degrees of nearsightedness.

    <h2>Fortified Lasik</h2>

    FORTIFIED LASIK<sup>&reg;</sup> has been the solution for many people who now enjoy freedom from contact lenses and glasses. People have this procedure for many different reasons: sports, relief from dry eyes or red eyes from contact lenses, or general overall convenience.
     
    FORTIFIED LASIK<sup>&reg;</sup> is a proprietary type of LASIK invented by Dr. Boxer Wachler. He is one of the world's leading vision correction eye surgeons. <b>A similar version of this procedure was first developed in Europe.</b>
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
    FORTIFIED LASIK<sup>&reg;</sup> is a combination of Dr. Brian's advanced LASIK + Dr. Brian's accelerated Holcomb C3-R<sup>&reg;</sup> (a cornea strengthening procedure that he invented in 2003). This reinforces the cornea to help guard against unwanted side effects that might otherwise occur without accelerated Holcomb C3-R<sup>&reg;</sup>.<br><br>
    It is well known that LASIK can weaken cornea with the creation of the flap combined with tissue removal to reshape your cornea. In some people this can cause a complication known as Ectasia or Keratoconus resulting in severe vision loss from the cornea bulging out like a hernia. Dr. Brian is known around the world for treating Ectasia and Keratoconus with procedures that he invented. That is the reason he developed Fortified LASIK<sup>&reg;</sup>. It uses his proprietary crosslinking process (Holcomb C3-R<sup>&reg;</sup>) to strengthen the cornea at the very end of the LASIK procedure. The crosslinking that Dr. Brian performs at the end of your LASIK procedure minimizes the risk of developing Ectasia or Keratoconus is extremely low. This is the reason strengthening the cornea with crosslinking is very important for your vision.

    <h2>PRK</h2>

    <p>
    PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) is a laser vision correction procedure performed by Dr. Brian at his office in Beverly Hills. The procedure involves gently moving the surface skin of the cornea and applying a laser to reshape the outer cornea.<br><br>
    PRK was the first type of laser eye surgery for vision correction. PRK preceded development of LASIK.<br><br>
    PRK does not require the creation of a flap; instead, a solution is applied to the eye and the laser is then applied to the surface of the cornea to reshape it. The surface skin heals over the treated area. <b>The visual results of PRK are similar to LASIK; however, vision is typically slower to recover.</b> This 5-10 minute procedure can treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Potential benefit is improved vision and potential risks are infection, inflammation and haze, among others. <b>That is the reason that Dr. Brian and every staff member here are highly "detail-oriented" "about each step of the process for every patient.</b><br><br>
    15 year-old PRK is very different than the modern-day PRK. Specialized drops and contact lenses are used postoperatively so the procedure is not typically painful in the way "old style" PRK was a decade ago.

    <h2>Natural Lens Replacement &amp; Cataract Treatments</h2>

    <p>
    Natural Lens Replacement is the process of adding an internal lens implant to the eye designed to correct reading vision (and distance vision too if that needs to be fixed as well). It is performed with the goal of improving your natural vision towards the way you used to have when you didn't need those darn reading glasses or bifocals - results though may vary patient to patient.<br><br>
    Patients who have Natural Lens Replacement typically cannot develop standard cataracts in the future since the biological lens has been replaced with a lens implant.
