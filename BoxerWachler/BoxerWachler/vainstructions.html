        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <br>
        <p><font color="red"><strong>Step 1</strong></font>. Each mobile device (iPhone, iPad etc.) has a different screen size and screen resolution. In order to provide a valid test on your mobile device, it will be necessary to "calibrate" your screen. This can be easily accomplished by zooming in on your screen until the "test" line is measured to be 1 inch with a ruler.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p><font color="red"><strong>Step 2.</strong></font> After zooming the line to be exactly 1 inch, place your iphone or ipad or other device 10 feet from where you are standing.</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>The initial display of letters is set at a vision reading of 20/20. If you can see the letters from 10 feet away in each eye, then you have very good vision - <strong>"20/20"</strong>.
        <br><br>
        If you can not read the letters from 10 feet then your vision may be worse than 20/20, so you should "Increase Size" of letters to the 20/25 vision setting by taping or clicking on the "Increase Size" button. You should continue increasing the letter size until you can correctly identify all of the letters from 10 feet away.</p>
