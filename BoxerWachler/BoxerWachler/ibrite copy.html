           <h2>Pinguecula Before and After Photos</h2>
           <p>
           Pingueculae are growths that form on or within the membrane of the eye. They usually occur on the inner corner of the eyes over the white area of the eye. If left untreated, they can grow and may increase eye irritation and redness. The cause of Pingueculae can be frequent sun exposure, pollution and the everyday environment.

           <h2>Pterygium Before and After Photos</h2>
           <p>
           If you notice that your Pinguecula is growing towards your pupil and impeding your vision, it is likely a Pterygium. Although side effects are uncommon, it is rare that they should happen. Dr. Brian discusses the procedure very thoroughly when you come in for your consultation.
