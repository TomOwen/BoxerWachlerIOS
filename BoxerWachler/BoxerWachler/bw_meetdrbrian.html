            <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"><img src="facility.jpg" alt="facility" width="260" height="184" style="margin-left: 10px; float: right;" /><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Not only is it important to choose the &ldquo;right doctor&rdquo; for your vision needs, but it is also important to choose the &ldquo;right facility&rdquo; for your eye concerns and treatment.</span></span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Choosing which eye correction procedure is right for you is an important decision.</strong> At Boxer Wachler Vision Institute, we spend a good deal of time upfront assessing your eyes so that we can make the best possible recommendations for your situation. Our patients must pass all of our testing to be a candidate.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 12pt;">Among the important tests that we perform are dry eye assessment, pupil size, corneal topography, and corneal thickness.

At your consultation, Dr. Brian will spend time answering all your questions so you feel comfortable with your decision for treatment.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img src="socks4homeless2.png" alt="socks4homeless2" width="270" height="279" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left;" />Our progressive Institute was designed with the comfort of the patient in mind. Patients often refer to the Institute being &ldquo;as relaxing as a spa!&rdquo;.</span></span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To help optimize our patients&rsquo; results, a &ldquo;humidity-controlled&rdquo; surgical facilities and our air filtration system removes bacteria, viruses, and particles as small as 0.003 microns.
