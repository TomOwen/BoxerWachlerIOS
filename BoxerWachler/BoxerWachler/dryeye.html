    The most common cause of Dry Eye Syndrome is the condition known as Blepharitis, which affects approximately 9 out of 10 Dry Eye cases (86%). However, Blepharitis is the most UNDER diagnosed cause of Dry Eye (if your eye doctor didn't press on your eyelids to see what comes out of the oil glands, then it's possible it was a missed diagnosis).<br><br>
    There are many different treatments that we offer at our Institute, including LipiFlow<sup>&reg;</sup>
    LipiFlow<sup>&reg;</sup> is a revolutionary treatment that opens up and cleans out the inflamed, clogged oil glands by gently heating the glands in the eyelid then "milking" out the inflammation-causing, clogged oils.

    The treatment is painless and only takes 12 minutes to perform. There is no downtime, just like having your teeth cleaned at the dentist. Many patients describe the procedure as a "spa treatment" for their eyelids.<br><br>
    Attempting to address Dry Eye with artificial tears alone does not deal with the root cause of the condition. Without the healthy natural oil, tears continue to evaporate faster than produced. When the oils are healthy, they mix with the tears to slow evaporation, thus creating a moister eye environment to help alleviate your Dry Eye symptoms.<br><br>
    Have you tried warm compresses? Many people have tried using warm compresses on the eyelids and finger massage to express the oil. Studies have found that this is not as effective as LipiFlow in cleaning out the clogged glands. Also many people are not able to do the at-home warm compress routine on a daily basis.<br><br>
    Dr. Brian pioneered the use of a testosterone cream applied to the eyelids after LipiFlow that is designed to reduce the re-accumulation of the clogged oils in your glands. Dr. Brian is an inventor of advanced dry treatments which he has received a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark office.
