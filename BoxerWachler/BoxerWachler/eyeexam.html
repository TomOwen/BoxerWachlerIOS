        <h1>Color Vision Test</h1>
        <p>
        There are various vision tests that evaluate many different functions of the eye. One of the more common test is the <b>Color Vision Test</b> which determines your ability to see different colors.
        <br><br>
        The following <b>Color Vision</b> test is not a medical evaluation of your vision and eyes. This test is not intended to replace regular visits to a medical eye professional to evaluate your vision and the health of your eyes. A comprehensive eye exam is the only way to insure your eyes are healthy and free from serious eye conditions or diseases.
        <br><br>
        A Color Vision test determines if you have a color vision deficiency, commonly known as color blindness. Color blindness is not a form of blindness, but a deficiency in the way you see color. With this vision condition, you have difficulty distinguishing certain colors, such as blue and yellow or red and green. Most color blind people see colors, but their color perception is limited and inaccurate. Do you have difficulty telling if colors are blue and yellow, or red and green?
